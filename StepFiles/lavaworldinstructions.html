<h2>Description of the Game:</h2>
<p>
This is the Lava World game you have previously seen. However, we have changed the locations of the lava spots.
The agent's goal remains the same: Reach the green goal state as quickly as possible without falling into lava! 
If the agent falls into the lava, a new episode will begin. 
</p>


<h2>Your task: Teach the agent how to solve Lava World</h2>
<p>
        The agent is represented as a blue circle. At the start of each episode, the agent will begin at the upper left most corner.
        The agent will move throughout the maze. Your job is to provide feedback to the agent by
        pressing the <strong> good</strong> or <strong> bad </strong> buttons. 
        This feedback will help the agent understand whether its behavior is good or bad, and will directly influence the agent's behavior.
        With your feedback, the agent can learn how to solve Lava World. 
        You will have 20 episodes to provide feedback to the agent. Keep in mind, the agent will remember what it has learned in previous episodes. 
        </p>


<p> Previously we suggested you use the <u>combined advising</u> strategy to provide feedback. 
This strategy involves you <strong>continually providing feedback</strong> to the agent at a steady rate as it interacts in the game.
At the same time, you want to make sure to provide feedback at <strong>important states</strong>. By important, we mean areas in the game where:</p>

<p>
1. The wrong action can lead the agent to have a major setback or possibly lose the game.
</p>

<p>
2. The right action can lead the agent to have a greater chance of winning the game.
</p>
</p>



<p>To familiarize yourself with the game beforehand, we provided an image of it below. As you are interacting with the agent during the game, you will know what the <strong>current game episode is,what action the agent is taking, and if the agent reached the goal</strong>. This information will be displayed above the maze as shown below.
